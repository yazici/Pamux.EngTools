2. Collect references.
3. Identify key characteristics.

. People should want to jump in and explore and enjoy being in the world, discover interesting stuff, etc.
. Should have foundation of reality (realistic topology, climate, erosion, etc.)
. Should feel familiar
. Should remind people a place they have been before (nostalgia?)
